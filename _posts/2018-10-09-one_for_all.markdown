   Project number two is in the books and I am finally feeling the groove.  Working through this project has given me so much more understanding and knowledge about how to solve problems on your own.  Being able to utilize the resources that are given to you and to buckle down and be willing to spend the time in the trenches with your error messages is priceless, learning to be tenacious is a must when playing the coding game.  With that being said, I personally still operate at my highest level when working with others so I did hit some hurdles that required me to seek some pro tips from another human in order to finish this project.  That in and of itself is a lesson that I still struggle with, being a tenacious army of one when the going gets tough is a prime skill, but if you're stuck, like stuck stuck....toss that pride in the garbage and like I said before, "utilize the resources that are given to you", even if those resources come in human form.  
   Working through this project also taught me how to really focus in on very small scale issues.  I ran into just about every error you could ever dream of but that's when I started prying into those errors like a rabid dog looking for his bone, I just needed to find out what was broken at that spot and stay with it until it was fixed and to not start working in other routes or views in hopes that when I came back it'd be all peachy.  I use to do that a lot and it just made things more complicated and messy so byebye to that.
   
   Here is a list of notable lessons learned while building this app:
	 
1. 	 Error messages are not 100% accurate, you shouldn't take them all at face value.  Many times I was getting errors for reasons completely unrelated to the actual cause of my problems.  Take them seriously, but also do your part to look through your syntax and double or triple check to see if any ends are out of place....it just might save you a days worth of hunting.
	 
1.       As I was building the flow of my app, I was constantly asking myself, "does that make sense, and would this enable the user to enjoy my app more?".  Once I got everyting working properly, I started to ask myself that question a lot as I was going through each page adding mobility for the user which would allow for them to clearly and easily navigate around the app to access all the diffferent pages and to easily log out if they got bored as hell looking through the library exercises.

1.    Lastly, I found out rather quickly that in order to make something work well you need to start slowyyyyyy.  I got all excited to start building this thing with all of the bells and whistles I could think of and it ended up costing me a ton of time due to countless errors.  For future me, I'll make sure to just get the dang thing operating properly and THEN i'll go in and put my fancy pants on.  I also learned I enjoy making things fancy more then I like making things operate, but that's probably because I need to get better at the operating part and learn to lean into my weaknesses and to not brush them off.
   
   To wrap it all up, working solo on fixing what was broken gave me a huge boost in confidence and it built tons of mental fortitude in the process.  Dancing with the issues that came up during this project was no easy task but a necessary one, attaining a little self sovereignty goes a long way.  Loved struggling through this project and getting it completed,  I can't wait to dive into more of the goodness!
