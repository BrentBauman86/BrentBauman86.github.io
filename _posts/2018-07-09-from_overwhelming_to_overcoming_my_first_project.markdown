   I finally made it through my first project and it feels amazinggggg!  Not to say that it didn't come at a price, I experienced just about every emotion possible while figting my way through this project, ranging from high levels of frustration and inadequacy, to laughter and pride.  Finding the humor in code is something I keep reminding myself to do when I get stuck with a problem, the best part about making issues humorus is that it makes being angry impossible.  
   
  * Setting up the project*
	    
  Getting this sucker to run with the proper structure took me almost an entire day to nail down but it was worth it.  Transitioning from the safe borders of the learn IDE to an open praire of problems was initially a daunting notion, but after a lot of trial and error I finally was able to flawlessly upload my project from my GitHub account.  I learned a lot about  how to dance between directories throughout this process, constantly making sure I was in the right one, seeing which other directories I could gain access to, and also gaining permission to certain files by using the chmod +x command.
   
   *How it all works together*
	    
  Figuring out where to put all of my code was probably the most challenging part of this project for me, just making sure everything was in the right place and being accessed properly has always been tough for me.  It took a while to figure out how to initiate and access my scraped data (like I said, tying all the information together is not my strong suite) but once I got that working things started to fall into place.  I also spent a lot of time playing around with how my data was displayed and what I wanted the user to see.  I thought it would be a good idea to add some regex to make my displayed data more appealing but wow oh wow do I hate regex's...there is just so many different ways to use them so I only infused a couple in my code.  

   Here is a quick breakdown of my workflow:
   1.  I decided to build my scraper class and gather all my data.
	 2.  Then I built out my brew class which creates all of my new brews.
	 3.  Lastly I finished with the CLI class and made all of my information nice and neat for the user to play with.
	 
	 Just to clarify, I really enjoy beer and my app allows you to seach for various types of beers so that's where my 'brew'      class came from.
			
  * Pry and errors*
       
  I got very handy with pry during this project, it was an absolute neccessity.  I learned a very important lesson when I was scraping my data...never assume that there are no errors on someones website.  So as I was scraping and putting the appropriate lines of code into my scraping methods I noticed that one of the items I was trying to grab wasn't working so I looked and looked and looked for the problem that I thought I was creating but to my surprise was actually an error on the website, 'description' was spelled 'descrption' and that little doozy put me back mentally BIG time.  Lesson learned though, just because you have a website up doesn't mean it's flawless.
			 
   Overall this project gave me the confidence to keep my chin up and dive head first into overwhelming situations  when they arise, it's really the only way to get past them.  Also, don't forget to laugh when you get frustrated, I promise it helps.
